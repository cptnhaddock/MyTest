### Check out project from GIT

**Note gerrit is only avalible from sigmaÂ´s network**

1. Login in on http://gerrit:8080/ (Your AD account should work)
2. Create a ssh public key (or skip to step 3 if you have a key):
	1. From the Terminal or Git Bash, run ssh-keygen
	2. Confirm the default path .ssh/id_rsa
	3. Enter a passphrase or leave it blank.
    (Remember this passphrase, as you will need it to unlock the
    key whenever you use it!)
    4. Open ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and copy & paste the contents into
    the box on the gerrit web ui, then click on "Add".
    __Note that id_rsa.pub is your public key and can be shared,
    while id_rsa is your private key and should be kept secret.__
2. Go to "settings" in gerrit and add your ssh key.
3. Verify your key by open a ssh shell on port 29418:
    1. ssh fraand@gerrit -p29418
4. Clone the git repository in you development folder.
    1. git clone ssh://[username]@gerrit:29418/Danir/Mikz/Web/Publisher

5. Happy coding :)
